#### LangChain Basics

* This repo includes basics of LangChain, OpenAI, ChromaDB and Pinecone (Vector databases).
* It covers interacting with OpenAI `GPT-3.5` model using LangChain.
* It also combines LangChain agents with OpenAI to search on Internet using `Google SERP API` and `Wikipedia`.
* It covers LangChain Chains using Sequential Chains
* Also covers loading your private data using LangChain documents loaders
* Splitting data into chunks using LangChain document splitters,
* Embedding splitted chunks into `Chroma DB` an `PineCone` databases using OpenAI Embeddings for search retrieval.
